We started this project with the intention of bringing back the dead game mode
"Naval Play", but seeing as the original creators are bringing that back, we need to re-brand.

So thusly let me introduce Naval Warfare! The free to host Naval Play!
We are releasing this game mode in a free to use, download, and modify (for personal use or develop with our permission).
This game mode is completely free to use in any server in any capacity!
(besides claiming it as your own)

You may want to download the full package if you are a first time installer, rather than using the SVN.
